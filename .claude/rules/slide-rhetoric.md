# Slide rhetoric principles

These principles govern all slide creation and review. See `templates/rhetoric_of_decks.md` for the full framework.

## The three laws

1. **Beauty is function.** A slide is beautiful when every element earns its presence, nothing distracts from the point, the eye knows where to go, and the mind grasps the idea instantly. Decoration without function is noise.

2. **Cognitive load is the enemy.** One idea per slide. This is not a guideline---it is the law. Too many points means zero points retained.

3. **The slide serves the spoken word.** If slides can be understood without the speaker, you have written a document and called it a presentation. The slide is a visual anchor, not a transcript.

## Rhetoric checks (enforced by review agents)

### Titles as assertions
Slide titles carry the argument. They are claims, not labels.
- Bad: "Results", "Literature Review", "Methods"
- Good: "Treatment increased distance by 61 miles on average"
- Good: "Prior work ignores the supply-side margin"
- Test: read only the titles in sequence---they should form a coherent argument.

### Pyramid principle
Lead with the conclusion, then support it. The audience wants the punchline first, then the evidence.
- Slide 2 (after title) should state the main finding or claim.
- Background and methodology support the claim---they do not precede it by 15 slides.
- Exception: teaching decks may build toward a conclusion when pedagogically motivated.

### One idea per slide
Every slide communicates exactly one idea. If you need two ideas, use two slides. The test: can you state the slide's point in one sentence? If not, split it.

### Marginal benefit / marginal cost equivalence
The optimal deck equalizes MB/MC across all slides. When one slide is overloaded while another is sparse, attention is misallocated.
- Overloaded slides (MB/MC too low): text in footer, competing ideas, charts with too many series.
- Underloaded slides (MB/MC too high): a single word that could support a sentence.
- The deck should breathe: dense technical slides demand lighter slides after them.

### Narrative arc
Every presentation tells a three-act story:
- Act I (tension): establish the problem, make the audience feel it.
- Act II (development): show what you tried, present evidence, build the case.
- Act III (resolution): deliver the insight, show implications, call to action.

### Opening and closing
- The first content slide must grab attention, establish stakes, and preview the journey. No "Today I'm going to talk about..." openings.
- The last slide determines what people remember. No generic "Questions?" or "Thank You" endings. End with a takeaway, a call to action, or a question that provokes continued thought.

### Devil's advocate
Before presenting your argument, present its strongest critique. This builds ethos, preempts objections, and establishes credibility.

## Beauty = clarity made visible

Apply visual hierarchy to every slide:
- **Primary**: the one thing you want remembered (large, prominent)
- **Secondary**: supporting evidence (smaller, subordinate)
- **Tertiary**: context and sourcing (smallest, footer)

If everything is emphasized, nothing is emphasized.

White space is not wasted space---it is rest for the eye, emphasis for the content, and confidence in your message. Crowded slides signal fear.

Bullets are a confession of defeat. Usually a list hides a sequence, a contrast, a hierarchy, or a causal chain. Find the structure and make it visible through layout.

## Context-specific adjustments

| Context | Emphasis | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Academic seminar | Logos 45%, Pathos 35%, Ethos 20% | Lead with the question, identification strategy early |
| Teaching deck | Clarity over brevity, repetition allowed | Show reasoning, not just conclusions |
| Working deck | Rigor over polish | Document choices, preserve uncertainty |
| Conference talk | One coefficient at a time | Acknowledge limitations before Q&A |
