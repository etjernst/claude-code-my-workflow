# .syncignore — Documents what stays out of Dropbox sync
#
# The sync operates between your Dropbox folder and project/ in this repo.
# Because of that scoping, repo infrastructure (listed below) never touches
# Dropbox — no exclusion rules needed. Your Dropbox project CAN have
# identically-named folders (scripts/, templates/, etc.) without conflict.
#
# Only universal artifacts (build files, OS junk) are actively filtered
# by the sync scripts.
#
# If you edit the artifact exclusions below, re-run: bash templates/setup-sync.sh

# ── Repo infrastructure (stays out of Dropbox by scoping, not filtering) ──
# These live at repo root, outside project/. Listed here for documentation
# only — the sync never sees them.
